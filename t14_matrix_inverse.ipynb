    "Matrix inverses are matrices which when multiplied by their oringinal matrices equate to the identity matrix. Only square matrices are invertible, but non square matrices may have a left or right inverse. A matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has a left inverse if there exists a matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ such that $\\mathbf{BA} = I$, and a right inverse if there exists a matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ such that $\\mathbf{AC} = I$ (Moon and Stirling, 2000). Square matrices that are not invertible are called singular matrices. A matrix is invertible if it has both a right and left inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix inverses are important because they provide solutions to the ubiquitous equation $\\mathbf{A}x = b$. There are many conditions that satisfy the invertibility of a matrix which will be explained in detail below. If a true matrix inverse does not exist for $\\mathbf{A}$, or if $\\mathbf{A}$ is not square, then the left and right pseudo inverses may be used to solve $\\mathbf{A}x = b$. "

    "## Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a robotic arm, (known more formally as a serial link manipulator), it is often necesary to find a set of joint angles that put the end manipulator in the correct pose (position and orientation). The process of finding the joint angles to reach a given pose is known as inverse kinematics. Arms with many joints are often too complex for an analytical solution in every case, and so a numerical solution can be computed using the pseudo inverse. This method is a form of gradient descent optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application, the vector $q$ contains the angles of each joint in the robot. $J(q)$ is the jacobian of the robot in a given position, such that $J(q) \\dot{q} = v$, where v is a 6-vector containing the linear and angular velocities of the end effector. The calculation of $J(q)$ is beyond the scope of this work, but is solved problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general method for inverse kinematics is as such:\n",
    "1. Set $q$ to some initial values\n",
    "2. Calculate the error $e$ between the end effector pose and the desired pose with joint angles $q$\n",
    "3. Update the joint angles: $q_{n+1} = q_n + \\alpha J(q)^\\dagger e$, where $\\alpha$ is a learning rate.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until the error $e$ is sufficiently small\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the pseudo inverse works well because it is flexible enough to work with underactuated arms. A problem with this direct approach is that $J(q)$ is not guaranteed to meet the requirements to have a pseudo inverse, often in configurations such as the arm reaching the edge of its workspace, or in situations similar to gimbal lock. To prevent this, a damped pseudo inverse is often used, $(J(q)^T J(q) + \\lambda I)^{-1}J(q)^T$, where $\\lambda$ is a damping coefficient. This change guarantees that a pseudo inverse exists."
