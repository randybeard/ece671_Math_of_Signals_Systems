    "The matrix inversion lemma is also known as the Sherman-Morrison formula or sometimes the Woodbury's idenity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion lemma says that the inverse of a rank-k correction of some matrix can be computed by doing a rank-k correction to the inverse of the original matrix. In other words, the lemma gives a method of finding the inverse of an updated matrix without having to directly compute the inverse of the entire updated matrix. This is possible if the original matrix's inverse in known. A common application is when something of low rank added to something of full rank and the inverse needs to be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $B^{-1} = (A+UCV)^{-1}$\n",
    ",the matrix inversion lemma finds $B^{-1}$ without computing it directly. If the size of the matrix is a large number, computing $B^{-1}$ directly is computational heavy. If this is the case finding $B^{-1}$ using a less computational heavy method is desired. The matrix inverstion lemma finds $B^{-1}$ using the known $A^{-1}$. The matrix inversion lemma proves that the inverse of the updated Matrix does not need to recomputed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion lemma can be used to provide an update to the inverse ot the Grammian matrix in a least-squares problem, to produce a simple version of what is known as the recursive least-squares (RLS) adaptive filter (explored in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion leema is applied in the Kalman filter and recursive least squares methods, to replace the parametric solution, requiring inversion of a state vector sized matrix, with a condition equations based solution. In case of the Kalman filter this matrix has the dimensions of the vector of observations, i.e., as small as 1 in case only one new observation is processed at a time. This significantly speeds up the often real time calculations of the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentailly this lemma is used in many engineering practices where input is constnaly being fed and the inverse of the new data set needs to be computed. This is common in control systems.\n"
